## Introduction

This is a repository to accompany a scientometric review of the journal Population Studies, written by Melinda C. Mills and Charles Rahal, entitled 'Population Studies at 75 Years: An empirical review'. It analyzes the ~2000 papers published by the journal in honour of the journal's 75th anniversary, and has been accepted for publication there. A links to open-access (OSF) version of the paper can be found [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ehy3w/).

## Pre-reqs

The library tries to minimize the number of pre-requisite installations outside of the standard library, and we recommend an Anaconda installation and a virtual environment to provide a managed package of comprehensive tools. However, a couple are necessary, including a range of modules found in the requirements.txt file (generated by pipreqs). Important libraries which the work couldnt be done without include [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), [NetworK-X](https://github.com/networkx), and [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk). The un-supervised LDA analysis is made possible with the help of [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) (the 'MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit'). Gender inference is done with a combination of [Gender-Guesser](https://github.com/lead-ratings/gender-guesser) and [Gender-Detector](https://github.com/malev/gender-detector).

## Data

The data originates from the [Scopus APIs](https://dev.elsevier.com/), using the appropriate ISSN (00324728) of the journal and the Search API. To recreate the dataset, first clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/crahal/PopStudies_Review.git```

```cd PopStudies_Review/src```

```python popstudies_scraper.py```

The functions in ```popstudies_preprocessor.py``` clean the data and prepare it for analysis. The formatted notebook which calls the analysis from ```popstudies_analysis.py``` is ```popstudies_notebook.ipynb```.
